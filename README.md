# Understanding Factors Influencing Bike Purchases

### Project Overview
---
This data analysis project aims to investigate the factors that influence whether a customer purchases a bike or not. The dataset includes information about customer characterists and purchase decisions.


### **ASK**
---
This phase involves defining the issue to be solved, identifying stakeholders and what their expectations from the project are.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. What Demographic Factors Influence Bike Purchases?
   
    - Explore the relationship between age, gender, and income levels of customers and their likelihood to purchase a bike.
  
    - Analyze if certain demographics are more inclined to make bike purchases and if there are specific preferences within different demographic segments.
  
3. How Does Customer Commute Distance Impact Bike Purchase Decisions?

   - Is there a correlation between the length of the customer commute and the likelihood of making a bike purchase?
     
   - Do customers with shorter commutes show a higher tendency to purchase bikes compared to those with longer commutes?

#### Business Task
Identify and understand the key factors influencing bike purchases to optimize marketing strategies.

#### Key Stakeholders
- **Marketting Analytics Team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
  
- **Executive Team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
